About the Dolphin window...
---------------------------

You can actually move the main toolbar of Dolphin. I simply move the bar to the
left-side of the window.

To do this, just right-click on the bar to show context menu, and unlock the bar.
Drag the bar to where you want it to be, and lock it back. Simple.
